# JS_210
Lauch School Frontend Course Work - JS210 - Computational Thinking and JavaScript Programming

# Curriculum Summary
Programming is a creative process that can be separated into two steps:

    Understand the problem to be solved, and build a virtual model that can solve the problem abstractly
    Implement the model and coding it in a formal programming language

Most "Introduction to JavaScript Programming" courses focus solely on the second step to teach JavaScript as a technology, or focus on how to use it to write programs, without helping students to develop the proper way of thinking and building mental models towards solving problems.

The goal of this course is to first and foremost, help beginners to think logically and computationally, together with a set of problem solving patterns; then secondarily, learn JavaScript as a programming language. For this purpose, we've made a concession on the side of learning JavaScript as a technology, to leave both the "Object Oriented" and the "Front End Development" aspect of the language to future courses, and teach a subset of the language to serve as an instrumentation tool to express logical solutions to problems.

For the computational thinking process, this course covers:

    think logically: analyzing the problem and solutions paths, the center and edge cases
    think procedurally and the bottom up, imperative solution expressions
    think abstractly: and the top down, declarative solution expressions
    common problem solving patterns

For JavaScript the programming language, this course covers:

    Language grammar, syntax and data types
    Functions and higher order functions
    Arrays and Objects as data structures
    Core built-in methods
    Writing idiomatic and stylistic code

The course comes with a rich set of exercises to focus on training computational thinking skills and practicing JavaScript language fundamentals.
